My personal portfolio website.
During web development course at ELTE, I was trying to do some personal assignment, like this portfolio.
On this website you can find informations about me, my studies, my projects, you can also download my CV.

On the Contact tab there is a form (and social media links), so you can reach me anytime.

I am trying to develop the website regulary, which contains design enhancement, optimization, and of course content update.
So I recommend visiting my page often.
